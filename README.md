# Recipes

Recipes is a personal recipe book, in the form of a static website.

This project was started to help catelogue my favourite recipes, share them with friends, and display information in my preferred format - particularly when it comes to simpler recipes or variants (e.g. Ice Cream) where I need a reference rather than a massive blog post.

The website acts as a PWA and can be installed on phone homescreens for quick reference.

The website is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and is published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Feel free to fork this repository and start your own recipe book!
