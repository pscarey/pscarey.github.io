# Sourdough Starter

## About

Starter is a raising agent cultivated from flour and water. It requires regular feeding for maintenance, and can be used in a range of baking recipes.

Starter is warmly acidic (i.e. acidic but sweet smelling), and appears as a bubbly dough. Typically it is stored in glass jars.

## Maintenance

Keeeping sourdough starter active requires regular action. The frequency depends on where the starter is kept:

- Cold, in the fridge, requires weekly feeding.
- Warm, in the pantry, requires 12HR feeding, and is more variable due to temperature changes.

Starter must be out of the fridge and active for usage.

Feeding the starter uses a lot of flour, and results in discarded waste, particularly if a large quantity is required. Instead, maintain a minimal amount of base starter which can be multiplied out as required.

### Ratios

All ratios are starter:flour:water. Recommended mass is noted for convenience in brackets, but should be adjusted as required for specific recipes.

#### Weekly Feeding in Fridge

Feed once weekly at 1:6:6 (5g:30g:30g).

#### Starter Activation from Fridge

To restore starter from the fridge for usage, feeding every 12 hrs:

- 1:6:6 (5g:30g:30g) x 2 
- 1:4:4 (8g:32g:32g) until growing 2.5x in size during 12hr cycle.

#### Activated (Warm) Starter Maintance

Maintain warm starter between a 1:4:4 (8g:32g:32g) and 1:2:2 (15g:30g:30g) ratio.

#### Expanding Starter

Levain for baking bread can be made with a 1:8:8 (10g:80g:80g) ratio. This will need to be approximately 10-20% of the final bread weight, and requires a 12hr cycle before usage.

### General Notes
- Temperature affects feeding cycles.
- Feeding should occur after the starter has peaked in size.
- Liquid, or 'hooch' requires tipping off and more frequent feeding.
- Waste can be either stored in the freezer or used immediately in [Sourdough Crackers]({{ relref "docs/Recipes/Baking/Sourdough/Starter" }})
